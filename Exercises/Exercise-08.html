            <h2>Welcome to Exercise 08</h2>
            <p>This exercise is a bit easier than the last one. In the last exercise you wrote some Javascript and put it in the HTML web page.
                This makes the page a bit cluttered as it contains both your content (the HTML) and your program (the Javascript).</p>
            <p>In this exercise we will move the Javascript into a separate file, just like we did with the CSS in Exercise 6. This will make your HTML file 
                easier to read as it will only contain the content of the page. It will also make it easier to reuse your Javascript code in other pages.</p>
            <p>The HTML part of the page (or at least the buttons) is the same as in the last exercise, but the Javascript is stored in a separate file. You 
                will also add a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag in the header of the HTML file to load the Javascript file.</p>
            <p>You will create three buttons. The first button will pop up a message when you click it. The second button will turn a message 
                in a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> on and off when you click it. The third button has no listener so will do nothing 
                when you click it.</p>
            <p>
                <button id="exercise-07-button">Click me!</button>
                <button id="exercise-07-button-2">Click me too!</button>
                <button id="exercise-07-button-3">Don't bother clicking me</button>

                This makes the page a bit cluttered as it contains both your content (the HTML) and your program (the Javascript).&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In this exercise we will move the Javascript into a seperate file, just like we did with the CSS in Exercise 6. This will make your HTML file 
                easier to read as it will only contain the content of the page. It will also make it easier to reuse your Javascript code in other pages.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The HTML part of the page (or at least the buttons) is the same as in the last exercise, but the Javascript is stored in a seperate file. You 
                will also add a &lt;code&gt;&lt;script&gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag in the header of the HTML file to load the Javascript file.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;You will create three buttons. The first buton will pop up a message when you click it. The second button will turn a message

            <h2>What you need to know</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>We are using the <code>&lt;script&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code> block in the header section to load the Javascript code. Notice that (unlike in the last exercise where the 
                javascript program was inside the block) there is nothing in the block itself and we are using the <code>src="exercise-08.js"</code> attribute to load the 
                program.</li>

                <li>The <code>&ltscript&gt;</code> tag also uses the <code>defer</code> attribute. This forces your broswer to wait until the whole HTML page has loaded before running any Javascript. 
                    Because the page is so small you probably won't notice the difference, but it is a good idea to use this attribute because the Javascript code uses HTML elements in the page 
                    (like the buttons and the output <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>) and if the Javascript code runs before the page has loaded, it won't be able to find the elements 
                    and will throw an error.</li>

                <li>The Javascript is the same as in the last exercise (except the buttons have new names) but notice you don't need <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;/script&gt;</code> 
                tags in the javascript file because the broswer already knows this is Javascript by the ime you load it.</li>

                <li>The actual code works in the same way as in exercise-07, so refere back to that if you need a reminder on how it works.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Exercise 08</h2>
            <p>In this exercise you will create a HTML document and a Javascript file to do something when you click the buttons. 
                You will use the &lt;script&gt; tag with the <code>src=""</code> and <code>defer</code> attibutes in the head rather than the body of the document.</p>
            <p>Copy the file <code>template.html</code> and name it <code>exercise-08.html</code>. If you prefer, you can create a new, empty file 
                called <code>exercise-08.html</code> and copy the code from the template file into it.</p>
            <p>Edit the file and add some content. You need to include the <code>&lt;button&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;/button&gt;</code> tags, and the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> and 
                <code>&lt;/div&gt;</code> tags, but do not put <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;/script&gt;</code> tags in the body. Make sure you give each button and the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> an 
                    unique id. You can use whatever you like for the id, but you will need to use the same ids in your Javascript code.</p>
            <p>Add the <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag in the head of the document. Use the <code>src="exercise-08.js"</code> attribute to load the Javascript file and the <code>defer</code> attribute to 
                make sure the Javascript code runs after the HTML page has loaded.</p>
            <p>Copy the file <code>template.js</code> and name it <code>exercise-08.js</code>. If you prefer, you can create a new, empty file 
                called <code>exercise-08.js</code> and copy the code from the template file into it.</p>

            <p>Write some Javascript code to do something when you click the buttons. You can use the code from the example above as a starting point.
                You can use the <code>document.getElementById()</code> method to get the button elements and the <code>addEventListener()</code> method to listen for a click event on the buttons. 
                You can use the <code>alert()</code> method to display a message when you click the first button. You can use the <code>innerHTML</code> property of the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> 
                element to display a message when you click the second button.</p>
            <p>When you are finished save your document then in your browser go to <a href="http://localhost:8000/exercise-08.html">http://localhost:8000/exercise-08.html</a> to 
                see what it looks like. Every time you make a change to a file, you need to save it and refresh the page in your browser to see the changes.</p>
            <p>If you are using Firefox as your browser you can use the <strong>Developer Tools</strong> to look at the JavaScript console. 
                To do this, right click on the page and select <strong>Inspect (Q)</strong>. This will open a new window at the bottom of the page where you can view the console in the console tab.
                If you have made any mistakes in your javascript that stop the program from running, you will see an error message in the console. These are known as <strong>bugs</strong> or 
                <strong>syntax errors</strong>. There are other kinds of bugs, in particular <strong>semantic errors</strong> are where the program runs but does not do what you expect it to do. Those are 
                often much harder to find and fix.
