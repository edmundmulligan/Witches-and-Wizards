                    some more structure to your HTML documents. They will look exactly the same as before, but they will allow you to add CSS and JavaScript to your pages more easily
                    in future lessons.

            <ul>
                <li><code>&lt;div&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> are used to mark up the structure of your document, much like <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;main&gt;</code>.</li>

                <li>You can see <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> being used in line 20-26 and 27-31. <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> is used in line 29.</li>

                <li><code>&lt;div&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> tags both work in the same way - the only difference is that <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> separates your page into blocks
                    of content with each block starting on a new line, while <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> is used to group together inline elements that are on the same line.</li>

        <h2 onclick="toggleSection('exercise', event);" class="magicInvisible">Exercise</h2>
        <section id="exercise" class="hidden">
            <p>In this exercise you will create a simple HTML document using the tags we have covered in this lesson. 
                You will use the &lt;div&gt;, and &lt;span&gt; tags.</p>
            <p>Copy the file <code>template.html</code> and name it <code>exercise-04.html</code>. If you prefer, you can create a new, empty file 
                called <code><exercise-04></exercise-04>exercise-04.html</code> and copy the code from the template file into it.</p>
            <p>Now write some content for your document. You can use the content from the previous examples or you can write something new. 
                You can also add some images using the &lt;img&gt; tag. There are several images you can use in the <code>Images</code> folder.</p>
                <p>Make sure you use some <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> tags.</p>
            <p>When you are finished save your document then in your browser go to <a href="http://localhost:8000/exercise-04.html">http://localhost:8000/exercise-04.html</a> to 
                see what it looks like. Every time you make a change to a file, you need to save it and refresh the page in your browser to see the changes.</p>
            <p>If you are using Firefox as your browser you can use the <strong>Developer Tools</strong> to see the HTML code for your page. 
                To do this, right click on the page and select <strong>Inspect (Q)</strong>. This will open a new window at the bottom of the page where you can explore the HTML elements of your page 
                in the Inspector tab. You should then
                be able to see the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> tags you have added but which are invisible on the main page.</p>
        </section>
        <h2 onclick="toggleSection('advanced-witches-and-wizards', event);" class="magicInvisible">Advanced Witches and Wizards</h2>
                <section id="advanced-witches-and-wizards" class="hidden">
        <p>You can't tell that a web page contains <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> just by looking at it, but you can use developer tools in your browser to see the code in your 
            web page.</p>
        
        <p>In Firefox, you can right click on the page and select <strong>View Page Source</strong>. This will open a new tab that shows you the HTML code just like in Visual Studio Code. The only difference 
            is that the colour coding may be different. This is because in Visual Studio Code you can load themes which use different colours.</p>

        <p>You can also use the <strong>Developer Tools</strong> to see the HTML code for your page. To do this, right click on the page and select <strong>Inspect (Q)</strong>. 
            This will open a new window at the bottom of the page where you can explore the HTML elements of your page in the Inspector tab.</p>

        <p>If you look at the page source for this page, you will see that it uses <code>&amp;lt;</code> and <code>&amp;gt;</code> lots of times. These are called HTML entities and they are used to represent 
            the <code>&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;</code> characters in HTML code. This is because if you just typed <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> in your HTML code, the browser would think you were trying to create 
            a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element, so I need to use the HTML entities instead to enable you to see what I mean.</p>
        
        <p> &amp;lt; is the HTML entity for <code>&lt;</code> and stands for "less than" while and &amp;gt; is the HTML entity for <code>&gt;</code> which stands for "greater than". 
            You can also use &amp;amp; for the <code>&amp;</code> character and you have already seen &amp;copy; used for the copyright &copy; symbol. You can find a list of all the HTML entities 
            <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_entities.asp" target="_blank">here</a></p>

        <p>Sharp eyed witches and wizards will have noticed that I have used the <code>&lt;code&gt;</code> tag 
            to mark up HTML code in this section. This makes the code stand out from the rest of the text and makes it easier to read. The tag works just like <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> except that it 
            has a predfined style that uses a fixed width font instead of the default font. You can change this appearance using CSS as you will soon discover.</p>
        </section>

        <h2 onclick="toggleSection('congratulations', event);" class="magicInvisible">Congratulations</h2>
        <section id="congratulations" class="hidden highlight">
            <p>Congratulations! You have completed the fourth exercise in the Web Witchcraft and Wizardry course. You web pages can now mark up their structure is much finer grain detail which will 
                be vital when you come to add CSS and Javascript to your page.</p>
            
            <p>You learned about the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> tags for structuring your HTML documents. THey are the most common tags used in HTML documents to
                group together sections of content. You also learned about the <code>&lt;code&gt;</code> tag which is used to mark up code in your HTML documents.</p>

            <p>In the next exercise you will learn how to add CSS to change the style of you web pages.</p>
