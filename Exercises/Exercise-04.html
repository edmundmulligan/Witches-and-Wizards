                    The last exercise was quite hard with lots of new material. This one is much easier because you are not really going to do anything. You will introduce
                    some more structure to your HTML documents. They will look exactly the same as before, but they will allow you to add CSS and JavaScript to your pages more easily
                    in future lessons.

            <ul>
                <li><code>&lt;div&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> tags both work in the same way - the only difference is that <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> separates your page into blocks
                    of content with each block starting on a new line, while <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> is used to group together inline elements that are on the same line.</li>

            <h2>Exercise 04</h2>
            <p>In this exercise you will create a simple HTML document using the tags we have covered in this lesson. 
                You will use the &lt;div&gt;, and &lt;span&gt; tags.</p>
            <p>Copy the file <code>template.html</code> and name it <code>exercise-04.html</code>. If you prefer, you can create a new, empty file 
                called <code><exercise-04></exercise-04>exercise-04.html</code> and copy the code from the template file into it.</p>
            <p>Now write some content for your document. You can use the content from the previous examples or you can write something new. 
                You can also add some images using the &lt;img&gt; tag. There are several images you can use in the <code>Images</code> folder.</p>
                <p>Make sure you use some <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> tags.</p>
            <p>When you are finished save your document then in your browser go to <a href="http://localhost:8000/exercise-04.html">http://localhost:8000/exercise-04.html</a> to 
                see what it looks like. Every time you make a change to a file, you need to save it and refresh the page in your browser to see the changes.</p>
            <p>If you are using Firefox as your browser you can use the <strong>Developer Tools</strong> to see the HTML code for your page. 
                To do this, right click on the page and select <strong>Inspect (Q)</strong>. This will open a new window at the bottom of the page where you can explore the HTML elements of your page 
                in the Inspector tab. You should then
                be able to see the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> tags you have added but which are invisible on the main page.</p>
