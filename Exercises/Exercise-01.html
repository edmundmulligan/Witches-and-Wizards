            <ul>
                <li>The first line is <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code> This tells your browser that this is a web page written using the HTML language. All web pages need to 
                    start with this line.</li>

                <li>In lines 2-5 we have some comments. Comments are not displayed in the browser, but are useful for web witches and wizards to 
                    understand the code. The comments in this document tell you that this is a file for the Web Witchcraft and Wizardry course and that it is licensed under the 
                    MIT License. Comments start with <code>&lt;!--</code> and end with <code>--&gt;</code>. You can use comments to explain your code, or remind yourself why you 
                    wrote something the way you did.</li>

                <li>Line 6 is an <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> tag. This tells your browser that eveything following this line is part of the HTML document. 
                    All HTML documents need to start with this and end with a corresponding <code>&lt;/html&gt;</code> line. The <code>lang="en"</code> attribute (which comes 
                    after the tag name but before the closing <code>&gt;</code>) indicates that the document is in English.</li>

                <li>HTML describes the structure of a web page. It is not a programming language, but a markup language. HTML uses tags to define elements on the page. Tags are 
                    enclosed in angle brackets, e.g., <code>&lt;tagname&gt;content&lt;/tagname&gt;</code> and note that (almost) every tag has a corresponding closing tag (that is 
                    the same as the opening tag but with a forward slash before the tag name).</li>

                <li>Tags can be nested inside each other. For example, you can have a <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tag inside a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> tag. Note you must make sure
                    that you close the tags in the correct order. For example, if you have a <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tag inside a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> tag, you must close
                    the <code>&lt;/p&gt;</code> tag before you close the <code>&lt;/div&gt;</code> tag. If you don't, the browser will not display the page correctly. This means 
                    that 
                    <pre>
&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
                    </pre>
                    is valid and will display correctly but 
                   <pre>
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
                    </pre>
                    is not valid and will not display correctly. The browser will try to guess what you mean, but it may not be what you intended. This is called <strong>HTML
                    parsing</strong>. The browser will try to fix the errors, but it is better to get it right in the first place. If you are not sure if your HTML is valid, you
                    can use a validator. There are many free validators available online. One of the most popular is the <a href="https://validator.w3.org/" target="_blank">W3C 
                    Markup  Validation Service</a>. This will check your HTML and tell you if there are any errors. It will also give you suggestions on how to fix them.</li>

                <li>If you are using <code>Visual Studio Code</code> to edit your web pages, the tool will help you by automatically adding the closing tag when you type the 
                    opening tag. If you delete the closing tag then when you type <code>&lt;/</code> the editor will automatically add the closing tag for you. This is very 
                    helpful, provided you remember this is happening. If you forget and write the whole of the closing tag, you will end up with a bit of HTML nonsense that will 
                    show up in the browser and you will need to go back and delete it. So be careful when you are editing your HTML code.</li>

                <li>Tags can also have attributes, which are additional information about the tag. For example, the <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> tag has a <code>lang</code> attribute 
                    that indicates the language of the document. Don't forget to look for the closing <code>&lt;/html&gt;</code> tag at the end of the document.</li>

                <li>Every html document has two sections between the <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;/html&gt;</code> tags: the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> and 
                    <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> sections. The <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> section contains information about the document, such as the title, character set, and links 
                    to stylesheets or scripts. The <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> section contains the content of the document that is displayed in the browser.</li>

                <li>The only tag that <strong>*MUST*</strong> be in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> section is the <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> tag. This tag defines the title of the 
                    document, which is displayed in the browser's title bar or tab. The title should be a short and descriptive name for the document. The title is not displayed on 
                    the page itself, but it is important for search engines and bookmarks. We will cover other tags that go in the header section in later lessons. As always 
                    you must have a closing tag for the title tag and a closing tag for the head section.</li>

                <li><code>&lt;meta&gt;</code> tags in the head section are used to define the information the browser needs to display the page correctly. The <code>meta charset</code> 
                    tag on line 9 defines the character set used in the document. The <code>meta viewport</code> tag in line 10 defines how the page should be displayed on different 
                    devices. This is important for responsive design, which is a way of making web pages look good on all devices.</li>

                <li>lines 12-25 are the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> section. This is where the content of the document goes. The content can be text, 
                    images, links, and other elements, even videos and sound clips.</li>

                <li>Evey web page will have different content in the body section but good practice is to have a <code>header</code> section (N.B. this is not the same as the 
                    <code>head</code> section in every HTML document), a <code>main</code> section, and a <code>footer</code> section. If you leave these sections out, the browser 
                    will still display the page but it may be harder to read and edit the page later. The <code>header</code> section usually contains the title of the document 
                    (this is often the same as the title used in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> section but it doesn't have to be) and a navigation menu. The <code>main</code> section 
                    contains the main content of the document. The <code>footer</code> section usually contains copyright information and links to other pages. Using 
                    structures like this will make it easier for search engines to find your page and for users to navigate your site. They will also make it easier for you to 
                    add CSS and JavaScript to your page to make your pages look and work better.</li>

                <li>The tags in the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> section to focus on in this exercise are the <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code>, and 
                    <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tags.</li>

                <li>The <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> tag in line 14 and <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> tag in line 18 are used for headings. The <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> tag is used for the main heading 
                    of the document and <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> is used for subheadings. You can have as many <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> tags as you like, but there should only be one 
                    <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> tag per document. You can also use <code>&lt;h3&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;h4&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;h5&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;h6&gt;</code> 
                    tags for subheadings, but these are not used as often.</li>

                <li>The <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tag in lines 19 and 23 is used for paragraphs of text. You can have as many <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tags as you like, but they should be used to 
                    break up the content into paragraphs. The <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tag is one of the very few tags that does not need a closing tag, although it is still good practice to 
                    use one.</li>

                <li>Note that HTML is not case sensitive, so you can use upper or lower case letters for the tags. However, it is good practice to use lower case letters for the tags 
                    and attributes. This makes the code easier to read and understand.</li>

                <li>Also note that HTML ignores extra spaces and line breaks, so you can use them to format your code to make it easier to read. 
                    For example, you can put each tag on a separate line, or you can indent the tags to show the structure of the document. This is not required, but it is good 
                    practice.</li>

                <li>We will cover other tags in later lessons as well as look at how to make the page look better using CSS and how to make it work better using JavaScript.</li>

                <li>Finally, the <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code> section in lines 22-24 contains copyright information and links to other pages. The copyright information is usually at the 
                    bottom of the page and should include the name of the author and the year. The links to other pages can be to other pages on your site or to external sites.</li>
                    <li>The <code>&amp;copy;</code> in line 23 is the code for the copyright symbol &copy;. HTML uses codes like this for displaying special symbols.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <h2 onclick="toggleSection('exercise', event);" class="magicInvisible">Exercise</h2>
        <section id="exercise" class="hidden">
            <p>In this exercise you will create a simple HTML document using the tags we have covered in this lesson. 
                You will use the &lt;html&gt;, &lt;head&gt;, &lt;body&gt;, &lt;h1&gt;, &lt;h2&gt;, and &lt;p&gt; tags.</p>

            <p>Copy the file <code>template.html</code> and name it <code>exercise-01.html</code>. If you prefer, you can create a new, empty file 
                called <code>exercise-01.html</code> and copy the code from the template file into it.</p>
            
            <p>Edit the file and add some content. If you don't know what to write, write something about witches and wizards. Make sure you use some of the 
                tags we have covered in this lesson. You can use the <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> tag for the title of the document, the <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> tag for
                the main heading, and the <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tag for paragraphs of text. Don't forget to put the heading in the <code>&lt;header&gt;</code> section and the
                paragraphs in the <code>&lt;main&gt;</code> section.

            <p>Make sure you have a closing tag for each of the tags you add. You can also add some comments using the &lt;!-- and --&gt; tags. 
                You can use the comments to explain what you are doing or to remind yourself what you need to do.</p>
            
            <p>Try to include several &lt;h2&gt; and &lt;p&gt; tags in your document. You can use the &lt;h2&gt; tags for subheadings and the &lt;p&gt; tags for
                paragraphs of text. You can write about anything you find intersting. If you are stuck for ideas use a heading of "Witches and Wizards" and have subheadings
                of "Witches" and "Wizards" then write some intersting paragraphs about witches and wizards under each subheading. And if you don't know anything 
                intersting, just make someting up!</p>
        
            <p>When you are finished save your document then in your browser go to <a href="http://localhost:8000/exercise-01.html">http://localhost:8000/exercise-01.html</a> to 
                see what it looks like. Every time you make a change to a file, you need to save it and refresh the page in your browser to see the changes.</p>

        <h2 onclick="toggleSection('advanced-witches-and-wizards', event);" class="magicInvisible">Advanced Witches and Wizards</h2>
        <section id="advanced-witches-and-wizards" class="hidden">
            <p>When you create a web page you create a <strong>document</strong>. The tags that you use define the structure of your documrnt and in later exercises you will 
                learn how to use that structure, knows as the <strong>Document Object Model</strong> or <strong>DOM</strong>, to change tha appearance of sections of your web page 
                with styles or to interact with the user of you web page using Javascript.</p>
            
            <p>The DOM is a <strong>hierarchical</strong> or <strong>tree</strong> structure. This means that the tags are arranged in a tree-like structure - imagine a tree with the 
                trunk in the ground (ignore the roots as this metaphor only works so far) and the main branches coming out of the trunk then smaller branches coming out of the 
                main branches and so on. The <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> tag is the trunk of the tree, and the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> tags are the
                main branches. The other tags are the smaller branches and leaves. The tree structure is important because it allows you to select and manipulate elements in the
                document using CSS and JavaScript.</p>
        
            <p>Imagine you have a web page that looks like this:
                <pre>
&lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;My Web Page&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;h1&gt;Welcome to my web page&lt;/h1&gt;
        &lt;section&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;About me&lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;My name is Edmund Mulligan and I am a web developer.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;My hobbies&lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;I am a STEM ambassador, I sing in a Male Voice Choir and I teach Nonviolent Communication.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/section&gt;
     &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
                </pre>
                </p>
            <p>The DOM model of this document would look like this:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>html</strong></li>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>head</strong></li>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>title</strong>: "My Web Page"</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li><strong>body</strong></li>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>h1</strong>: "Welcome to my web page"</li>
                            <li><strong>section</strong></li>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>h2</strong>: "About me"</li>
                                <li><strong>p</strong>: "My name is Edmund Mulligan and I am a web developer."</li>
                                <li><strong>h2</strong>: "My hobbies"</li>
                                <li><strong>p</strong>: "I am a STEM ambassador, I sing in a Male Voice Choir and I teach Nonviolent Communication."</li>
                            </ul>
                        </ul>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
            </p>
    
            <p>Note that the elements in the DOM match the tags in the HTML document, but there are no closing tags in the DOM. You can reference the elements of the 
                DOM using the <strong>dot notation</strong>. For example, you can reference the <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> element using <code>document.body.h1</code>.
                You can also reference the <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> elements using <code>document.body.section.h2</code>. In later exercises you will learn how to give 
                elements <strong>ids</strong> and <strong>classes</strong> so you can distinguish between elements of the same type.</p>
