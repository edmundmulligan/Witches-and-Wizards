        <section id="what-you-need-to-know" class="hidden">
            <h3>Lists</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Unnumbered lists display as bullet points in the browser. A list starts with the <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> tag and finishes, as 
                    always with a <code>&lt;/ul&gt;</code> tag.</li>

                <li>Ordered lists display as numbers in the browser. They work in the same way as unnumbered lists, but they use with the 
                    <code>&lt;ol&gt;</code> tag instead of the <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> tag.</li>

                <li>Each item in the list is enclosed in <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;/li&gt;</code> tags. You can have as many items in 
                    the list as you like.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Images</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Images are added to the page using the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag. This tag does not have a closing tag. The <code>src</code> attribute is used to specify the
                    location of the image file. </li>
                    
                <li>The <code>alt</code> attribute is used to specify an alternative text for the image. This text is displayed if the image cannot be loaded.</li>

                <li>The <code>style</code> attribute is used to specify the size of the image. In this case, the image is 300 pixels wide and the height is set to auto, which means it will 
                    be scaled to maintain the aspect ratio of the image. We will look at style more in exercises 5 and 6.</li>

                <li>In this example the image being displayed is on your computer in the <code>images</code> directory. The <code>src</code> attribute is set to 
                    <code>/resources/images/witch-and-wizard.jpg</code>. You can also show pictures that are on the internet by using a full URL 
                    in the <code>src</code> attribute. For example, <code>src="https://example.com/image.jpg"</code>. This will display the image from the internet instead of from your 
                    computer. This can be a bit risky as the image may get changed or deleted from the internet and then your page will be broken and you have no control over it. So, it 
                    is safest to use images that are on your computer.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <h2 onclick="toggleSection('exercise', event);" class="magicInvisible">Exercise</h2>
        <section id="exercise" class="hidden">
            <p>In this exercise you will create a simple HTML document with lists and images. 
                You will use the &lt;ul&gt;, &lt;ol&gt;, &lt;li&gt;, and &lt;img&gt; tags as well as the ones you used in exercise 1.</p>
            <p>Copy the file <code>template.html</code> and name it <code>exercise-02.html</code>. If you prefer, you can create a new, empty file 
                called <code>exercise-02.html</code> and copy the code from the template file into it.</p>
            <p>Create a heading for the page using the &lt;h1&gt; tag. This should be the title of your page. 
                You can use any text you like, but it should be something that describes what the page is about. If you are stuck for ideas, call it "Witches and Wizards".</p>
            <p>Create a subheading using the &lt;h2&gt; tag. You can call it "Witches"</p>
            <p>After the sub heading, create a paragraph with the &lt;p&gt; tag and write a short description of what a witch is.</p>
            <p>Now include a picture of a witch using the &lt;img&gt; tag. You can use search for a picture of a witch on the internet or use <code>young-witch.jpg</code> from the <code>Images</code> 
                directory. Make sure you use the correct path to the image file. You can use the <code>style</code> attribute to set the size of the image. Also make sure you use the <code>alt</code> attribute 
                to set the alternative text for the image.</p>
            <p>Next create an unnumbered list using the &lt;ul&gt; tag. This should be a list of things that witches do. You can use the following items in the list:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Cast spells</li>
                <li>Make potions</li>
                <li>Fly on broomsticks</li>
                <li>Talk to animals</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Now do the same for wizards. Create a subheading using the &lt;h2&gt; tag. You can call it "Wizards". Create a paragraph that describes what a wizard is. There is an image you can use 
                called <code>young-wizard.jpg</code> in the <code>Images</code> directory if you don't want to search the internet for your own.</p>
            <p>This time create an ordered list using the &lt;ol&gt; tag. This should be a list of things that wizards do. You can use the following items in the list:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Cast spells</li>
                <li>Wears a pointy hat</li>
                <li>Uses a magic staff</li>
                <li>Has a spell book</li>
            </ol>
            <p>When you are finished save your document then in your browser go to <a href="http://localhost:8000/exercise-02.html">http://localhost:8000/exercise-02.html</a> to 
                see what it looks like. Every time you make a change to a file, you need to save it and refresh the page in your browser to see the changes.</p>
        </section>
        <h2 onclick="toggleSection('advanced-witches-and-wizards', event);" class="magicInvisible">Advanced Witches and Wizards</h2>
        <section id="advanced-witches-and-wizards" class="hidden">
            <h3>Lists</h3>
            <p>You can nest lists inside other lists. For example, you can have an unnumbered list inside an ordered list or an ordered list inside 
                an unnumbered list. This is done by putting the <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;ol&gt;</code> tags inside the <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> 
                tags. It is very important that if you do this, you have a closing tag for each of the lists and you put them in the correct order. If you 
                don't, the browser will not display the page correctly.</p>
            <p>Here is an example of an unordered list inside an unorderd list</p>
            <pre>
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Witches&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Wizards&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Monsters&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Vampires&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Werewolves&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Ghosts&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
            </pre>
            <p>It looks like this</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Witches</li>
                <li>Wizards</li>
                <li>Monsters</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Vampires</li>
                    <li>Werewolves</li>
                    <li>Ghosts</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            <p>Notice that the inner list is indented. This is done automatically by the browser and ignores any indentation in the HTML page. Also notice that the bullet points for the inner list are different 
                from the outer list. This is also done automatically by the browser. Each level of indentation uses different style bullets, but more than two levels of indentation is considered bad style by 
                many designers and writers.</p>

            <h3>Images</h3>
            <p>Images come in different formats and you should choose the format that is best for the type of image you are using. The most common formats are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>GIF</strong> (Graphics Interchange Format) - This format is best for simple images with few colors, such as cartoons and animations. It uses lossless compression and supports transparency, but it only supports 
                    256 colors. GIFS can also be animated, which means that they can display a series of images in a loop. This is done by using multiple frames in the same file. The browser will display each frame 
                    in turn, creating the illusion of movement. The main disadvantage og GIF is that the compression used was patented by a company who wanted to charge everyone who used the GIF format a royalty. The 
                    patent has now expired so using GIF format is free, but it led to the development of PNG as a replacement.</li>
                <li><strong>PNG</strong> (Portable Network Graphics) - This format is best for images with fewer colors, such as logos and icons. It uses lossless compression, which means that the image quality is not affected by the compression. 
                    It also supports transparency. PNG is usually preferred over GIF for images with transparency because it supports more colors and has better quality. PNG is also better for images with text, such as 
                    screenshots and diagrams.</li>
                <li><strong>JPEG</strong> (Joint Photographic Experts Group) - This is the most common format for photographs. It uses a lot of compression to make the file size smaller, but this can result in a loss of quality. It is best for images with lots 
                    of colors and details.</li>
                <li><strong>SVG</strong> (Scalable Vector Graphics) - This format is best for vector images, such as logos and icons. SVG uses mathematical equations to describe the image. This means that if you zoom in on the image, it will not lose quality,
                    unlike GIF, PNG and JPEG. SVG is also smaller than other formats because it does not use pixels to represent the image.</li>
                <li><strong>WebP</strong> - This is a newer format that is designed to be smaller than JPEG and PNG. It uses lossy and lossless compression, which means that it can be used for both photographs and simple images. 
                    It is supported by most modern browsers.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Of course, if you download an image from the internet, you have to use the format that it comes in. You can convert images from one format to another using a program like GIMP or Photoshop. You can also use online tools like 
                <a href="https://www.online-convert.com/" target="_blank">Online Convert</a> or <a href="https://convertio.co/" target="_blank">Convertio</a>. These tools allow you to upload an image and choose the format you want to convert it to.</p>
