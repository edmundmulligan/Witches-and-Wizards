            <p>It's best to do the exercises in order as each one builds on the previous one. There is no time limit for doing the exercises - 
                some people want to go through them quite quickly while others choose to go more slowly, trying things out and experimenting as 
                they go. There is no right way to do it, so just go at your own pace.</p>
            <p>Each exercise has a section for Advanced Witches and Wizards. This contains extra information that is not needed to complete the 
                exercise, but which will help you understand some of the things that are going on behind the scenes. Tome of these topics are 
                quie advanced (hence the section title) but they are things that real developers think about all the time.</p>
