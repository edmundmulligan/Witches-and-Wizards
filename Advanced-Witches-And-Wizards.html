        <div id="web-basics" class="hidden">
            <p>Here are some basic questions and answers about the web:</p>
            <h3 onclick="toggleSection('web-basics-01', event);" class="magicInvisible">What is the difference
                between the Internet and the World Wide Web?</h3>
            <div id="web-basics-01" class="hidden">
                <p>The Internet was invented in the 1960s as a way to connect computers together so they could share
                    information. It was originally a military project started during
                    the Cold War, and so it was designed to be a decentralized network that could withstand a
                    nuclear attack. That made it very robust and reliable, but it was also
                    very complex and difficult to use. Although it allowed computers to share information at a basic
                    level, it was not user-friendly and required a lot of technical
                    knowledge to use.</p>

                <p>The World Wide Web was created as a way to make the Internet more user-friendly. It was designed
                    to be a system of interlinked hypertext documents that could be
                    accessed via the Internet using a web browser. The World Wide Web made it much easier for people
                    to access and share information on the Internet, and it quickly became the dominant way people
                    used the Internet.</p>

                <p>The World Wide Web started as a way to share text dissertations and research papers among
                    scientists, but the launguage used to create web pages (HTML)
                    and the protocols used to access them (HTTP) quickly evolved to allow for more complex and
                    interactive content.</p>
            </div>

            <h3 onclick="toggleSection('web-basics-02', event);" class="magicInvisible">Who invented the World Wide
                Web?</h3>
            <div id="web-basics-02" class="hidden">
                <p>The World Wide Web was invented by Tim Berners-Lee in 1989 while he was working at CERN (the
                    European Organization for Nuclear Research) in Switzerland.
                    He created the first web browser and web server, and he also developed the first version of HTML
                    (Hypertext Markup Language), which is the standard language used
                    to create web pages.</p>
            </div>

            <h3 onclick="toggleSection('web-basics-03', event);" class="magicInvisible">How does the web work?</h3>
            <div id="web-basics-03" class="hidden">
                <p>The web works by using a system of interlinked hypertext documents that are accessed via the
                    Internet. When you click on a link, your web browser sends a request
                    to the server that hosts the document, and the server sends the document back to your browser.
                </p>
            </div>

            <h3 onclick="toggleSection('web-basics-04', event);" class="magicInvisible">What is a web server?</h3>
            <div id="web-basics-04" class="hidden">
                <p>A web server is a computer that stores web pages and serves them to users when they request them.
                    It uses HTTP (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol) to communicate with web
                    browsers. A web server can host multiple websites and can handle many requests at the same time.
                    Any computer can be a web server so long as it is
                    connected to the Internet and has the necessary software installed. Usually, though, it is a
                    powerful computer with a lot of storage space and a fast Internet
                    connection.</p>
            </div>

            <h3 onclick="toggleSection('web-basics-05', event);" class="magicInvisible">What is URL?</h3>
            <div id="web-basics-05" class="hidden">
                <p>A URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is the address of a web page and is the basic way to access
                    resources on the web. It specifies the location of a resource on the
                    Internet and consists of a protocol (usually HTTP or HTTPS), a domain name, and a path to the
                    specific page. It may also contain a query string or fragmen
                    identifier to specify additional parameters or sections of the page.</p>
            </div>

            <h3 onclick="toggleSection('web-basics-06', event);" class="magicInvisible">What is HTML?</h3>
            <div id="web-basics-06" class="hidden">
                <p>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard markup language for creating web pages. It is
                    used to structure content on the web.
                    The current version of HTML is HTML5, which includes features and improvements over previous
                    versions which makes it easier to create modern, interactive web pages.</p>

                <p>HTML uses tags to define elements on a web page, such as headings, paragraphs, links, images, and
                    more. These tags are used to create the structure of the page and
                    to apply styles and formatting to the content. HTML is not a programming language, but rather a
                    markup language that describes the structure of a web page.</p>

                <p>HTML is the backbone of web development and is used in conjunction with CSS (Cascading Style
                    Sheets) and JavaScript to create dynamic and interactive web pages.</p>
            </div>

            <h3 onclick="toggleSection('web-basics-07', event);" class="magicInvisible">What is CSS?</h3>
            <div id="web-basics-07" class="hidden">
                <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a
                    document written in HTML. It is used to control the layout
                    and appearance of web pages.</p>

                <p>CSS allows developers to separate the content of a web page from its presentation, making it
                    easier to maintain and update the design of a website.
                    It provides a way to apply styles to HTML elements, such as colors, fonts, spacing, and
                    positioning. CSS can be applied to a web page in several ways, including
                    inline styles, internal style sheets, and external style sheets.</p>

                <p>CSS is an essential part of web development and is used in conjunction with HTML and JavaScript
                    to create visually appealing and responsive web pages.</p>
            </div>

            <h3 onclick="toggleSection('web-basics-08', event);" class="magicInvisible">What is JavaScript?</h3>
            <div id="web-basics-08" class="hidden">
                <p>JavaScript is a programming language that is commonly used to create interactive effects within
                    web browsers. It is used to add dynamic behavior to web pages.</p>

                <p>JavaScript can be used to manipulate HTML and CSS, allowing developers to create interactive
                    elements such as forms, animations, and real-time updates.
                    It is a versatile language that is an essential part of modern web development and is used in
                    conjunction with HTML and CSS to create dynamic and interactive web
                    applications.</p>
            </div>

            <h3 onclick="toggleSection('web-basics-09', event);" class="magicInvisible">What does a web browser do?</h3>
            <div id="web-basics-09" class="hidden">
                <p>A web browser is a software application that allows users to access and view web pages. It
                    interprets HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to display the content of a
                    web page.</p>

                <p>When a user enters a URL into the browser's address bar or clicks on a link, the browser sends a
                    request to the web server that hosts the page. The server then
                    sends the requested page back to the browser, which renders the content and displays it to the
                    user. The browser also handles user interactions, such as clicking
                    links, filling out forms, and navigating between pages.</p>

                <p>Popular web browsers include Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, and Apple Safari.
                    Each browser has its own features and capabilities, but they all
                    serve the same basic purpose of allowing users to access and interact with web content.</p>
            </div>

            <h3 onclick="toggleSection('web-basics-10', event);" class="magicInvisible">What is a 404 error?</h3>
            <div id="web-basics-10" class="hidden">
                <p>A 404 error is an HTTP status code that indicates that the requested page could not be found on
                    the server. This usually means that the page has been moved or
                    deleted.</p>

                <p>Whenever a browser sends a request to a server, the serrver responds with a status code to
                    indicate the result of the request. A status code of 200 means that the request was
                    successful and the page was found, while a status code of 404 means that the page could not be
                    found.</p>

                <p>Other common HTTP status codes include 500 (Internal Server Error), which indicates that there
                    was a problem with the server, and 403 (Forbidden), which indicates that the user
                    does not have permission to access the requested page.</p>

                <p>A full list of HTTP status codes can be found on the <a
                        href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status" target="_blank">MDN Web
                        Docs</a>.</p>
            </div>

            <h3 onclick="toggleSection('web-basics-11', event);" class="magicInvisible">What is a cookie?</h3>
            <div id="web-basics-11" class="hidden">
                <p>A cookie is a small piece of data that is stored on the user's computer by the web browser while
                    browsing a website. Cookies are used to remember information about
                    the user, such as login credentials, preferences, and shopping cart contents.</p>

                <p>When a user visits a website, the server can send a cookie to the user's browser, which stores it
                    on the user's computer. The browser then sends the cookie back to
                    the server with each subsequent request to the same website. This allows the server to recognize
                    the user and provide a personalized experience.</p>

                <p>Cookies can be used for various purposes, such as tracking user behavior, remembering user
                    preferences, and maintaining session state. They can also be used for
                    advertising and analytics purposes.</p>

                <p>Cookies can be classified into two types: session cookies and persistent cookies. Session cookies
                    are temporary and are deleted when the user closes the browser,
                    while persistent cookies are stored on the user's computer for a specified period of time.</p>
            </div>

            <h3 onclick="toggleSection('web-basics-12', event);" class="magicInvisible">What is streaming?</h3>
            <div id="web-basics-12" class="hidden">
                <p>Traditionally when you want to download a file from the Internet, your browser sends a request to the
                    server that hosts the file, and the server sends the entire file to your browser.
                    This means that you have to wait until the entire file has been downloaded before you can start using it.</p>

                <p>Streaming is a method of transmitting or receiving data over the Internet in real-time, allowing
                    users to access and consume content without having to download it
                    first. This is commonly used for audio and video content, such as music, movies, and live
                    broadcasts.</p>

                <p>Streaming works by breaking the content into small chunks and sending them over the Internet in a
                    continuous flow. The user's device then receives these chunks
                    and plays them back in real-time, allowing the user to start watching or listening to the content
                    almost immediately.</p>

                <p>Streaming can be done using various protocols, such as HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) and Real-Time
                    Messaging Protocol (RTMP). It requires a stable Internet connection and sufficient bandwidth to
                    ensure smooth playback without interruptions.</p>
            </div>

            <h3 onclick="toggleSection('web-basics-13', event);" class="magicInvisible">What is a Search Engine?</h3>
            <div id="web-basics-13" class="hidden">
                <p>There are a lot of web pages on the Internet - no one knows exactly how many but some
                    estimates suggest over a billion. With that many pages, it would be impossible
                    to remember the address of every page you want to visit. So Search Engines were invented to
                    help you find the pages you want.</p>

                <p>Search Engines work by creating an index of all the web pages on the Internet. They use
                    automated programs called crawlers or spiders to visit each page and collect
                    information about it. This information is then stored in a database, which allows the search
                    engine to quickly find and retrieve relevant pages when a user enters
                    a search query.</p>

                <p>When you enter a search query into a search engine, it uses algorithms to analyze the index
                    and return a list of relevant pages. The search engine ranks the
                    pages based on various factors, such as the relevance of the content to the search query,
                    the quality of the page, and the authority of the website.</p>

                <p>Some search engines also use machine learning and artificial intelligence to improve their
                    algorithms and provide more accurate and relevant results.</p>

                <p>Some search engines, like Google, collect data about users' search behavior to improve their
                    algorithms and provide personalized results.
                    This data can include information about the user's location, search history, and
                    preferences. Others focus on privacy and do not track users' search behavior,
                    such as DuckDuckGo.</p>

                <p>Popular search engines include Google, Bing, and DuckDuckGo. Each search engine has its own
                    unique algorithms and ranking factors, which can affect the results
                    returned for a given search query.</p>
            </div>

            <h3 onclick="toggleSection('web-basics-14', event);" class="magicInvisible">What is SEO?</h3>
            <div id="web-basics-14" class="hidden">
                <p>SEO (Search Engine Optimization) is the process of improving the visibility of a website or a
                    web page in a search engine's organic results.</p>

                <p>With so many web pages on the Internet, it is important to make sure that your web page is
                    easy to find.
                    SEO is a set of techniques and best practices that can help improve a website's ranking in
                    search engine results pages (SERPs).</p>

                <p>SEO involves optimizing various elements of a website, such as the content, structure, and
                    metadata, to make it more relevant and appealing to search engines.
                    This can include using relevant keywords, optimizing page titles and descriptions, improving
                    site speed and mobile-friendliness, and building high-quality backlinks.</p>

                <p>SEO is an ongoing process that requires continuous monitoring and adjustment to keep up with
                    changes in search engine algorithms and user behavior.
                    It is an essential part of digital marketing and can help drive organic traffic to a
                    website, increase brand visibility, and improve user experience.</p>

            <p>Here are some tips and tricks that real developers use to make their lives easier:</p>
                
            <h3 onclick="toggleSection('tips-and-tricks-01', event);" class="magicInvisible">Make backups of your work.</h3>
            <div id="tips-and-tricks-01" class="hidden">
                <p>Always make backups of your work to avoid losing it in case of a computer crash or other
                    disaster. Use cloud storage or external hard drives to keep your files safe. Even if you don't use the cloud, copy 
                    your files to another folder. Back up everything before you make changes to it - you never know when you might make 
                    a mistake and get back the origial version./p>
                
                <p>If you ignore all the other tips on this page, at least remember this one. It will save you a lot of wasted time and frustration.</p>
            </div>
    
            <h3 onclick="toggleSection('tips-and-tricks-02', event);" class="magicInvisible">Use folders to organize your files.</h3>
            <div id="tips-and-tricks-02" class="hidden">
                <p>Organize your files into folders to make it easier to find what you need. Use descriptive
                    names for your folders and files to help you remember what they contain.</p>

                <p>If you want a good example of how to organize your files, look at the folder structure of this website. It is organized into three 
                    folders: backups, exercises and resources. The backups folder is for you to store your backups, the exercises folder is where 
                    the exercise pages are stored and the resources folder has subfolders for html files, css files, javascript files and images.</p>
            </div>

            <h3 onclick="toggleSection('tips-and-tricks-03', event);" class="magicInvisible">Use consistent naming conventions.</h3>
            <div id="tips-and-tricks-03" class="hidden">
                <p>Use consistent naming conventions for your files and folders to make it easier to find what
                    you need. Use lowercase letters and separate words with underscores or hyphens.</p>
                
                <p>You won't believe how much easier it is to write programs when you use consistent naming conventions. 
                    It makes it easier to read and understand your code, and it helps you avoid mistakes.</p>

                <p>Using consistent names doesn't just apply to files and folders, it also applies to variables, functions, classes and other code elements.
                    For example, if you have a variable that stores a user's name, you might call it <code>user_name</code> or <code>userName</code>.
                    The important thing is to be consistent in your naming conventions so that you can easily understand your code.</p>
            </div>

            <h3 onclick="toggleSection('tips-and-tricks-04', event);" class="magicInvisible">Don't repeat yourself.</h3>
            <div id="tips-and-tricks-04" class="hidden">
                <p>Don't repeat yourself (DRY) is a principle of software development that states that you
                    should not write the same code multiple times. If you find you are briting the same or similar code in multiple places,
                    it is a sign that you need to refactor your code to make it more modular and reusable. You can do this by 
                    creating functions or classes that encapsulate the reusable code.</p>
                <p>For example, suppose you have three buttons in your HTML that all need to respond in the same way:</p>
                <pre>
<code>&lt;button id="button1"&gt;Button 1&lt;/button&gt;</code>
<code>&lt;button id="button2"&gt;Button 2&lt;/button&gt;</code>
<code>&lt;button id="button3"&gt;Button 3&lt;/button&gt;</code>
                </pre>

                <p>You could write the event handlers for each button like this:</p>
                <pre>
<code>document.getElementById("button1").addEventListener("click", function() { alert("Button 1 clicked!"); });</code>
<code>document.getElementById("button2").addEventListener("click", function() { alert("Button 2 clicked!"); });</code>
<code>document.getElementById("button3").addEventListener("click", function() { alert("Button 3 clicked!"); });</code>
                </pre>
                <p>But this is not very DRY, because you are repeating the same code three times. Instead, you could
                    create a function that handles the button click event and pass the button ID as a parameter:</p>
                <pre>
<code>function handleButtonClick(buttonId) {</code>
<code>    alert(buttonId + " clicked!");</code>
<code>}</code>
<code>document.getElementById("button1").addEventListener("click", function() { handleButtonClick("Button 1"); });</code>
<code>document.getElementById("button2").addEventListener("click", function() { handleButtonClick("Button 2"); });</code>
<code>document.getElementById("button3").addEventListener("click", function() { handleButtonClick("Button 3"); });</code>
                </pre>
                <p>Now you have a single function that handles the button click event, and you can easily add more
                    buttons without repeating the same code. It may not look much better in this simple example,
                    but in larger programs, it can make a big difference in terms of readability and maintainability.</p>
            </div>

            <h3 onclick="toggleSection('tips-and-tricks-05', event);" class="magicInvisible">Comment your code.</h3>
            <div id="tips-and-tricks-05" class="hidden">
                <p>Comment your code to explain what it does and how it works. This will help you and others
                    understand your code when you come back to it later.</p>
                <p>A really useful comment you can add to your code is a "TODO" comment. This is a comment that
                    reminds you to do something later, such as fix a bug or add a feature. You can use it to keep
                    track of things you need to do in your code. In fact, many code editors and IDEs 
                    like Visual Studio have built-in support for TODO comments, 
                    which makes it easy to find and manage them.</p>
                <p>For example, you could add a TODO comment like this:</p>
                <pre>
<code>// TODO: Fix the bug in this function</code>
<code>function myFunction() {</code>
<code>    // Some code which doesn't work here</code>
<code>}</code>
                </pre>
                <p>Then, when you come back to your code later, you can search for "TODO" to find all the places
                    where you need to make changes.</p>
            </div>

            <h3 onclick="toggleSection('tips-and-tricks-06', event);" class="magicInvisible">Always test everything.</h3>
            <div id="tips-and-tricks-06" class="hidden">
                <p>Always test your code to make sure it works as expected.</p>
                <p>Testing is an essential part of software development. It helps you catch bugs and errors before
                    they become a problem. A good rule of thumb is If it hasn't been tested, it doesn't work.</p>

                <p>There are many different types of testing, including unit testing, integration testing, and
                    end-to-end testing. Each type of testing has its own purpose and can help you catch different
                    types of bugs.</p>
                
                <p>Real software developers spend more time testing their code than writing it. They know that testing 
                    is the key to delivering high-quality software that meets the needs of users.</p>

            <h3 onclick="toggleSection('tips-and-tricks-07', event);" class="magicInvisible">Make sure your web page is secure so it can't be hacked.</h3>
            <div id="tips-and-tricks-07" class="hidden">
                <p>Make sure your web page is secure to prevent unauthorized access and data breaches. Use
                    HTTPS, validate user input, and keep your software up to date.</p>
                <p>It is very easy to make a web page that is vulnerable to hacking. 
                    Hackers can exploit vulnerabilities in your code to gain access to your server, steal data, or even take control of your website.</p>
                <p>Here is an example of a simple web page that is vulnerable to hacking:</p>
                <pre>
<code>&lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;My Web Page&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;h1&gt;Welcome to my web page!&lt;/h1&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This is a simple web page that is vulnerable to hacking.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;form action="submit.php" method="post"&gt;
            &lt;label for="username"&gt;Username:&lt;/label&gt;
            &lt;input type="text" id="username" name="username"&gt;&lt;/input&gt;
            &lt;label for="password"&gt;Password:&lt;/label&gt;
            &lt;input type="password" id="password" name="password"&gt;&lt;/input&gt;
            &lt;input type="submit" value="Submit"&gt;&lt;/input&gt;
        &lt;/form&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code>
                </pre>
                <p>This web page has a form that allows users to enter their username and password. However, it does not
                    validate the input or use HTTPS, which makes it vulnerable to hacking.</p>
                <p>To make this web page more secure, you could add input validation to ensure that the username and
                    password meet certain criteria, such as length and complexity. You could also use HTTPS to encrypt
                    the data being sent to the server.</p>
                <p>Here is an example of a more secure web page:</p>
                <pre>
<code>&lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;My Secure Web Page&lt;/title&gt;
        &lt;script&gt;
            function validateForm() {
                const username = document.getElementById("username").value;
                const password = document.getElementById("password").value;
                if (username.length < 3 || password.length < 6) {
                    alert("Username must be at least 3 characters and password must be at least 6 characters long.");
                    return false;
                }
                return true;
            }
        &lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;h1&gt;Welcome to my secure web page!&lt;/h1&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This is a secure web page that validates user input and uses HTTPS.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;form action="submit.php" method="post" onsubmit="return validateForm()"&gt;
            &lt;label for="username"&gt;Username:&lt;/label&gt;
            &lt;input type="text" id="username" name="username" required&gt;&lt;/input&gt;
            &lt;label for="password"&gt;Password:&lt;/label&gt;
            &lt;input type="password" id="password" name="password" required&gt;&lt;/input&gt;
            &lt;input type="submit" value="Submit"&gt;&lt;/input&gt;
        &lt;/form&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code>
                </pre>
                <p>This web page uses JavaScript to validate the input before submitting the form, and it also uses
                    the "required" attribute to ensure that the user enters a value for both fields. This makes it more
                    secure and less vulnerable to hacking.</p>

                <p>Note that this is a good start but it is not enough to make your web page completely secure. You would also need to implement server-side validation,
                    use prepared statements to prevent SQL injection attacks, and implement other security measures to protect your web page from hacking.</p>

            <div id="more-about-witches-and-wizards-03" class="hidden">
                <p>In Terry Pratchett's humerous Discworld series, witches are often portrayed as wise and 
                    powerful, but also as practical and down-to-earth. They are often seen as the
                    guardians of the community and are respected for their knowledge of herbs and healing. Wizards, 
                    on the other hand, are often portrayed as arrogant and self-important,
                    believing themselves to be superior to witches. They are often more focused on
                    theoretical magic and academic pursuits, rather than practical applications.</p>

                <p>Witches always wear black while wizards have pointy hats. Wiches fly on broomsticks but 
                    wizards think that is beneath them and prefer to fly on magic carpets. There is a popular 
                    drinking song, sung in Discworld taverns called "A Wizard's Staff Has a Knob On The End".</p>

                <p>Generally in the Discworld series, witches are women and wizards are men. But Equal Rites, one of the 
                    first Discworld novels, tells the story of a young woman named Eskarina Smith who
                    wants to become a wizard. And the last book, The Shepherd's Crown, published posthumously, features a 
                    young man named Geoffrey who wants to become a witch.</p>

                <p>In the Wizard of Oz, Glinda the Good is portrayed as a kind and benevolent witch, while Elphaba the Wicked Witch of the West is, well, wicked. 
                    However, in the musical Wicked, Elphaba is portrayed as a misunderstood and complex character who is fighting against the oppressive system of Oz. 
                    She sings the show stopping song, "Defying Gravity" at the end of the first act, which has become an anthem for empowerment and self-acceptance.</p>

                <p>In King Arthur legends, Morgan le Fay is often portrayed as a powerful and mysterious witch who is both an ally and an enemy of Arthur.
                    The sword in the stone, which Arthur pulls out to prove his right to the throne, is not the same sword as Excalibur, which is given to him by the 
                    Lady of the Lake later in the story. Merlin is based on a combination of historical and mythical figures, including the Welsh prophet Myrddin Wyllt 
                    and the Romano-British war leader Ambrosius Aurelianus.</p>

                <p>Baba Yaga is a fascinating character from East European folklore. She is often portrayed as a fearsome witch who lives in a hut that walks on chicken legs.
                    However, she is also known for her wisdom and knowledge of magic. In some stories, she helps heroes on their quests, while in others, she is a formidable foe.</p>
                
                <p>Arthur Millers's play The Crucible, which is set during the Salem witch trials in America in the 17th century, explores the theme of mass hysteria and the 
                    consequences of false accusations. It is a powerful commentary on the dangers of fear and ignorance, and how they can lead to tragic outcomes. 
                    It was written as an allegory for the McCarthy era in the 1950s, when people were accused of being communists without any evidence, leading to a climate 
                    of fear and suspicion.</p>

                <p>In England, witches were not burned at the stake but hanged. The last person executed for witchcraft in England was Alice Molland, who was hanged in Exeter 
                    in 1685. However, the last confirmed execution for witchcraft in England is sometimes attributed to Mary Hicks and her daughter Elizabeth, who were hanged 
                    in 1716. After that, the Witchcraft Act of 1735 made it illegal to accuse someone of witchcraft, effectively ending executions for witchcraft in England.</p>

                <p>Sir Isaac Newton, the famous physicist and mathematician and discoverer of gravity (except everyone who ever dropped anything probably also discovered gravity, but 
                    he was the one who wrote it down and published it), was also interested in alchemy and the occult. He wrote extensively on these subjects, 
                    although much of his work was not published during his lifetime. He believed that alchemy could lead to the discovery of the Philosopher's Stone, a mythical substance 
                    that could turn base metals into gold and grant immortality.</p>
