            <p>On this page you will find some handy information that will help you on your journey to becoming a web witch or wizard.
                None of this is needed to complete the exercises, but it will help you understand some of the things that are going on behind the scenes.
                If you are interested in learning more about any of these topics, check out the links at the bottom of the main page. Some of the information 
                is a bit technical, but don't worry if you don't understand it all. Just try to get the gist of it 
                and don't worry about the details. There are also some tips and tricks that real developers use to make their lives easier.
