# Web Witchcraft and Wizardry for learning HTML, CSS and JS

Welcome *Web Witch or Wizard* to the world of web development! Here, you will learn the art of creating stunning websites and applications. For a certain value of stunning, especially if you are easily stunned. What I'm saying is this will get you started but there is a lot more to the World Wide Web than you will cover in this introduction. But I'll give you enough to start exploring on your own, if you are curious. And witches and wizards are always curious. So you are in the right place.

## What you need
- A computer with an internet connection. If you are at a Code Dojo, please ask one of the mentors for the internet password if you need it.
- A web browser (e.g. https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/)
- A text editor (e.g.,  https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- Python (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- These exercises, see the next section: How to get started

## How to get started
1. Browse to https://github.com/edmundmulligan/Witches-and-Wizards
2. Click on the code button towards the top right of this screen.
3. Select Download ZIP.
4. When the download is complete copy the zip file (Witches-And-Wizards-main.zip) from your Download folder to a local folder on your computer.
5. Right click on the copied zip file and extract its contents. This will create a folder called Witches-And-Wizards-main.
6. Browse to the created folder and open index.html in your web browser. Depending on how your computer is set up, you may not see the .html extension in which case open the index file.
7. If a web page opens up in your browser with a picture of a witch and wizard then you are good to go.
8. If the picture is missing, then you probably opened the zip file instead of extracting its contents. Go back to step 5 and try again.
9. Some of these instructions may differ slightly depending on what operating system you are using and how it has been set up, so you may need to improvise a bit. Again, if you are at a Code Dojo, you can ask a mentor for help if you get stuck.

## What you are going to do
These exercises are an introduction to web development using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. There is far more to web development than we will cover 
in these exercises, but they will give you a good start. You will learn how to create web pages using HTML, and how to add images, 
lists, tables, and hyperlinks to your pages. You will also change how web pages look using CSS styles and allow people to interact with your pages using JavaScript.

These exercises are designed to be done in a web browser and a text editor. You will need to download the files from GitHub and open them in your web browser.
You will also need to open the files in a text editor so you can edit them. You can use any web browser and any text editor you like, but we recommend using 
Mozilla Firefox and Visual Studio Code.

Note that you will not be writing any python code in these exercises, but you will need it to run a local web server. Without it, your browser may block loading javascript files to make your computer more secure.

## Ready to do some witchcraft and wizardry?
1. Make sure Visual Studio Code and Python are installed on your computer. You only need to do this the first time you run these exercises after that they should be there.
2. Start Visual Studio Code and open the Witches-and-Wizards-main folder. You can do this by clicking on File, then Open Folder, and selecting the Witches-and-Wizards-main folder. 
you should see a list of files and folders in the left-hand pane.
3. In Visual Studio Code go to the menu at the top of the window, click on Terminal and select New Terminal. This will open a terminal window at the bottom of the screen.
4. In the terminal window start the local server by typing  python -m http.server and pressing enter.
5. You should see Serving HTTP on :: port 8000 (http://[::]:8000/) ... which tells you everything is working fine.
6. Do *not* close the terminal window as that will stop the local server from running. You can minimise, hide or ignore the terminal window. You won't need it for anything else in these exercises.
7. Open your browser and browse to http://localhost:8000 You should see the Web Witchcraft and Wizardry home page, including all the instructions in this README file.
8. You can now switch between Visual Studio Code (where you will be writing your web pages) and your browser where you will be viewing them.
