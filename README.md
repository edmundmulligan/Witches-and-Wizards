# Witches-and-Wizards
Web Wizardry for learning HTML, CSS and JS

Welcome to the world of web development! Here, you will learn the art of creating stunning websites and applications.

These exercises are an introduction to web development using HTML. There is far more to web development than we will cover 
in these exercises, but they will give you a good start. You will learn how to create web pages using HTML, and how to add images, 
lists, tables, and hyperlinks to your pages. You will also change how web pages look using syles and allow people to interact with your pages using JavaScript.

These exercises are designed to be done in a web browser and a text editor. You will need to download the files from GitHub and open them in your web browser.

Mozilla Firefox and Visual Studio Code.
