# Web Witchcraft and Wizardry
Welcome *Web Witch or Wizard* to the world of web development! Here, you will learn the art of creating stunning websites and applications. For a certain value of stunning, especially if you are easily stunned. What I'm saying is this will get you started but there is a lot more to the World Wide Web than you will cover in this introduction. But I'll give you enough to start exploring on your own, if you are curious. And witches and wizards are always curious. So you are in the right place.

## Prior Knowledge
- This course is for people who want to learn how to write good web pages. By good, I mean well structured and secure, not that the content is good - that will be down to you. 
- Some experience of writing computer programs is useful; that could be using Scratch or Python but you do not need to have used JavaScript or PHP before.
- You should have some experience of browsing the web and following hyperlinks, but I assume that that applies to everyone these days.

## What you need
- A computer with an internet connection. If you are at a Code Dojo, please ask one of the mentors for the internet password if you need it.
- A web browser (e.g. https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/)
- A code editor (e.g.,  https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- PHP (https://www.php.net/)
- SQLite (https://sqlite.org/)

## How to get started
1. Browse to https://github.com/edmundmulligan/Witches-and-Wizards
2. Click on the green code button towards the top right of this screen.
3. Select Download ZIP.
4. When the download is complete copy the zip file (Witches-And-Wizards-main.zip) from your Download folder to a local folder on your computer.
5. Right click on the copied zip file and extract its contents. This will create a folder called Witches-And-Wizards-main.
6. Browse to the created folder and open index.html in your web browser. Depending on how your computer is set up, you may not see the .html extension in which case open the index file.
7. If a web page opens up in your browser with a picture of a witch and wizard then you are good to go.
8. If the picture is missing, then you probably opened the zip file instead of extracting its contents. Go back to step 5 and try again.
9. Some of these instructions may differ slightly depending on what operating system you are using and how it has been set up, so you may need to improvise a bit. Again, if you are at a Code Dojo, you can ask a mentor for help if you get stuck.

## What you are going to do
These exercises are an introduction to web development using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Later on you will also learn about PHP and SQL to do even more advanced witchcraft and wizardry. There is far more to web development than we will cover in these exercises, but they will give you a good start. You will learn how to 
create web pages using HTML, and how to add images, lists, tables, and hyperlinks to your pages. You will also change how web pages look using CSS styles and allow people to interact with your pages using JavaScript.

## Ready to do some witchcraft and wizardry?
1. Make sure Visual Studio Code, PHP and SQLite are installed on your computer. You only need to do this the first time you run these exercises; after that they should always be there. If you are using a Code Dojo computer these should already be installed for you. Otherwise the <a href="/mentors/">Mentors</a> page has instructions for setting up a computer to do these exercises.
2. Start Visual Studio Code and open the Witches-and-Wizards-main folder. You can do this by clicking on File, then Open Folder, and selecting the Witches-and-Wizards-main folder. 
You should see a list of files and folders in the left-hand pane.
3. In Visual Studio Code go to the menu at the top of the window, click on Terminal and select New Terminal. This will open a terminal window at the bottom of the screen.
4. In the terminal window start the local server by typing php -S localhost:8000 and pressing enter.
5. You should see something like [Sun Jun 22 20:51:38 2025] PHP 8.4.3 Development Server (http://localhost:8000) started which tells you everything is working fine.
6. Do *not* close the terminal window as that will stop the local server from running. You can minimise, hide or ignore the terminal window. You won't need it for anything else in these exercises.
7. Open your browser and browse to http://localhost:8000 You should see the Web Witchcraft and Wizardry home page, including these instructions.
8. You can now switch between Visual Studio Code (where you will be writing your web pages) and your browser where you will be viewing them.
